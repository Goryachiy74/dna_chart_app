# 🧬 DNA Chart App

**DNA Chart App** is a powerful bioinformatics tool designed to analyze DNA sequences and generate insightful charts.  
The app supports multiple types of DNA analysis and visualization, including:  
✅ Word Frequency Analysis  
✅ Isochore GC Content Distribution  
✅ Scatter Plots  

Built with **Python** and a clean graphical user interface using **Tkinter**, this tool is ideal for genomic analysis and visualization.

## 📌 **Features**
### 🔎 **1. Word Frequency Chart**
- Analyzes DNA segments to calculate word frequency.  
- Filters based on a threshold value.  
- Generates a clean bar chart of the most common words.  

### 🧬 **2. Isochore GC Content Chart**
- Calculates the GC content across different segments.  
- Plots GC content against genomic positions.  
- Marks the classification boundaries (`L1/L2`, `H1/H2`, `H2/H3`).  

### 📊 **3. Scatter Plot**
- Visualizes DNA segment lengths vs. starting positions.  
- Interactive plots using **Plotly**.  
- Highlights best-matching DNA words.  

### 🎯 **4. View Saved Charts**
- Opens the saved charts folder directly from the app.  
- Works on **Windows, MacOS, and Linux**.
